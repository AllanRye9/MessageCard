Here is a basic example of how you can create an editable HTML element using JavaScript:

HTML:

```html
<div id="editable" contenteditable="true">This text can be edited by the user.</div>
<button onclick="save()">Save</button>
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
function save() {
var editable = document.getElementById("editable");
var text = editable.innerHTML;
// Save the text to a database or file
console.log("Saved text: " + text);
}
```

In this example, we have a `div` element with the `contenteditable` attribute set to `true`, which allows the user to edit the text inside the element. We also have a button with an `onclick` attribute that calls the `save()` function when clicked.

The `save()` function gets the `div` element by its ID and retrieves the edited text using the `innerHTML` property. You can then save this text to a database or file using AJAX or other methods.

Note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs.
